# AI-TestPlan-Generation

This repo demonstrates how AI can generate structured **QA Test Plans** from requirement specifications.  

## Structure
- `requirements/` → Contains requirement specification documents  
- `prompts/` → Prompt(s) used for generating the test plan  
- `outputs/` → Final AI-generated Test Plan  

## Focus
Currently, the repo focuses on **Test Plan Generation** only.  
Future scope may include extending to test case generation.
